# Realtime-human-behavior-in-Streamed-video
Discription:
With the increase of elderly people living alone and the continuous opening up of society, people are increasingly concerned about how to detect a person sitting at home can notify the medical support needed, specially for elderly people. The model is not suffering from overfitting because the validation loss is decreasing, and the difference in accuracy between the training and validation sets is relatively small. These studies focus solely on detecting and classifying human behaviors and do not provide information on the various patterns of human behaviors. This research just classify or detect human behaviors but do not tell the different patterns of human behaviors.
The aim of the research is to develop the system than can effectively detect abnormal behavior events or potential hazards to reinforce the limitations of traditional monitoring systems that require labor attention and reduce the mental load of security staff.To avoid misjudgement, when a certain number of detected abnormal behaviors or a fall reaches a preset threshold, the monitoring system will trigger a warning mechanism and send a message to the monitor to ensure instant reminder and response to avoid more serious consequences. Since abnormal behavior is usually irregular and happens in a short period of time, it requires continuous monitoring. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a surveillance system that can instantly detect abnormal behavior in aged people or elderly people who are above 65.
